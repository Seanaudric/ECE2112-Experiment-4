# ECE2112-Experiment-4

This repository is for the Experiment 4 of my ECE2112 - Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms course. The notebook uploaded contains Python codes that deal with different sample problems given.

## Given Problems

### Problem 1: Create the following data frames based on the format provided: Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas.
a) Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon.                              
b) Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female.

### PROBLEM 2: Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. 
 
## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Anaconda Navigator
* Jupyter Notebook
* Any version of Windows/MacOS/Linus that can run the programs above

### Executing the program/s
* How to run the program
* In every code cell, press Shift + Enter to run that specific cell
* It is necessary to run "import numpy as np" and "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" as the python code is dependent on these libraries
* It is also necessary to store the .xlsx file in the same folder to use the dataframe
